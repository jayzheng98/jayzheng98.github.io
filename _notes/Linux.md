# Vim
<hr>

Vim is a popular and build-in text editor of Linux systems. In most of the cases I use it to modify configuration files of networking or apps

**1. Three modes**
 - *Command mode: Default mode, can be used to move the cursor to view content*
 - *Insert mode: Press the "i" button to enter, and edit the text*
 - *Bottom-line mode: Press the ":" button to enter, and to save and exit*

<div align="center"> <img alt="3modes" src="https://github.com/jayzheng98/jayzheng98.github.io/blob/master/images/linux1.png?raw=true" width="500px"> </div><br>

**2. Commands in the bottom-line mode**

| Command | Description |
|:--------|:--------:|
| :w | Write to disk|
| :w! | Force writing to disk when the file is read-only|
| :q | Leave |
| :q! | Force leaving without saving |
| :wq | Leave after writing to disk |
| :wq!| Leave after forcing writing to disk |

# Network Configuration
<hr>

In case we have to construct a network includes Linux systems, usually we have to config static IP addresses for them. Here I use "Ubuntu 18.04" as an example (configurations on "CentOS" and "Fedora" are similar)

**1. System UI**

<img alt="l2" src="https://github.com/jayzheng98/jayzheng98.github.io/blob/master/images/linux2.png?raw=true" width="220px"> <img alt="l3" src="https://github.com/jayzheng98/jayzheng98.github.io/blob/master/images/linux3.png?raw=true" width="400px"> <img alt="l4" src="https://github.com/jayzheng98/jayzheng98.github.io/blob/master/images/linux4.png?raw=true" width="340px">

<br>

**2. CommandLine**
 - *Use* `ifconfig` *to check the name of targeted network card*
 
<div align="center"> <img alt="l5" src="https://github.com/jayzheng98/jayzheng98.github.io/blob/master/images/linux5.png?raw=true" width="450px"> </div>

 - *Use* `sudo vi /etc/network/interfaces` *or* `sudo gedit /etc/network/interfaces` *to open the configuration file*
 
<div align="center"> <img alt="l6" src="https://github.com/jayzheng98/jayzheng98.github.io/blob/master/images/linux6.png?raw=true" width="450px"> </div>
 
 - *Insert your modification based on the following template, and save the changes*

```
auto ens33
iface ens33 inet static
address 192.168.4.200
netmask 255.255.255.0
gateway 192.168.4.1
```
   
<div align="center"> <img alt="l7" src="https://github.com/jayzheng98/jayzheng98.github.io/blob/master/images/linux7.png?raw=true" width="450px"> </div>
   
 - *Use one of the following commands to restart the network or simply restart the system to activate the new configuration:*

```
/etc/init.d/networking restart
sudo service network-manager restart
sudo service networking restart
```

# Change Permission
<hr>

**1. Problem**
 - *I used to install the [SysmonForLinux](https://github.com/Sysinternals/SysmonForLinux) on my ubuntu18, and the system logs that Sysmon generates are stored in the "/var/log/syslog". Later I wanted the transmission tool [Nxlog](https://nxlog.co/products/nxlog-enterprise-edition) to transmit those logs to my ELK mainframe. However, the permission of "syslog" is read-only, Nxlog cannot retrieve any data from it*

**2. Rationale**
 - *Insufficient privilege*

**3. Solution1**
 - *A common thought to address the problem aforementioned is to change the permission of the targeted file using* `sudo chmod 777 /var/log/syslog` *. It does work at first, nevertheless, I find that the permission of "syslog" will turn back to read-only each time I restart the system*

**4. Solution2**
 - *Another way to solve the problem is to grant the application a higher permission to access the target. Using* `sudo gedit /etc/passwd` *we can not only grant apps but also users. To do this, simply change the corresponding number after the "x:" to "0"*

<div align="center"> <img alt="l8" src="https://github.com/jayzheng98/jayzheng98.github.io/blob/master/images/linux8.png?raw=true" width="660px"> </div>

 - *In the highlighted part of the pic above, I've granted Nxlog the highest permission as the changed number is actually the UID, and the UID of root user is "0"*

# Remove File Lock
<hr>

**1. Problem**
 - *The error below often occurs when installing applications using the apt command on Ubuntu:*

<div align="center"> <img alt="l9" src="https://github.com/jayzheng98/jayzheng98.github.io/blob/master/images/linux9.png?raw=true" width="600px"> </div>

**2. Rationale**
 - *File locks are used to prevent two or more processes from using the same data. When apt or apt-get commands are running, they create lock files in a few places. If the previous apt command was not terminated properly, the lock files are not deleted and hence they prevent any new instances of apt-get or apt commands*

**3. Solution**
 - *Use* `ps -e | grep apt` *to find out related processes*
 - *Use* `sudo kill PID` *to terminate processes if returned*
 - *Use the following commands to safely remove the locks:*

```
sudo rm /var/lib/apt/lists/lock
sudo rm /var/cache/apt/archives/lock
sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock
```
