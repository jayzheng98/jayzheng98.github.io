# Introduction
<hr>

**1.** There are already very detailed [official tutorials](https://www.arangodb.com/docs/stable/) about ArangoDB, so it is meaningless to reproduce them here
 - *Tutorial1: If you were familiar with SQL, you can get started quickly with AQL by referring [this](https://www.arangodb.com/community-server/sql-aql-comparison/)*
 - *Tutorial2: [Operate it with Python](https://www.arangodb.com/tutorials/tutorial-python/)*

**2.** This note will mianly record my operations on ArangoDB while working on [this project](/projects/project2)
