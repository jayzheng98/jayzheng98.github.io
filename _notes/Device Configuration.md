# Introduction
<hr>

As mentioned in the [project](), I've set up a simulation shooting range in my laboratory according to the network topology of high-speed railway signal system, and the topology diagram is shown below. This article roughly records my networking process

# Layer 3 Switch
<hr>

## Cisco 
**1. Device overview**
 - *The layer 3 switch in the pic is [Catalyst 3560G series](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/switches/catalyst-3560-series-switches/series.html)*

<div align="center"> <img alt="dc2" src="https://github.com/jayzheng98/jayzheng98.github.io/blob/master/images/dc1.jpg?raw=true" width="550px"> </div><br>

**2. Connect for configuration**
 - *Usually there is a <u>console interface</u> behind the switch*

<div align="center"> <img alt="dc3" src="https://github.com/jayzheng98/jayzheng98.github.io/blob/master/images/dc2.jpg?raw=true" width="350px"> </div>

 - *Connect it with PC by the console cable*

<div align="center"> <img alt="dc4" src="https://github.com/jayzheng98/jayzheng98.github.io/blob/master/images/dc3.jpg?raw=true" width="300px"> </div><br>

**3. Set up for configuration**
 - *Download the [Hyper Terminal](https://www.hilgraeve.com/hyperterminal-trial/) which provides us with the terminal to configure devices*
 - *Set up a new connection, and select the <u>cluster communication port(COM)</u> which was former connected with console cable*

<div align="center"> <img alt="dc5" src="https://github.com/jayzheng98/jayzheng98.github.io/blob/master/images/dc4.png?raw=true" width="300px">    <img alt="dc6" src="https://github.com/jayzheng98/jayzheng98.github.io/blob/master/images/dc5.png?raw=true" width="400px"> </div>

 - *When you see the* `Switch>` *, it means that you have successfully connected to your device*

**4. Configure**
 - *Here are some useful commands to configure Cisco switches*
 
```
enable 
conf ter

// Create vlan "xx" and configure IP (address, mask)
vlanxx
int vlan xx
ip add 192.168.4.1 255.255.255.0

// Include ports in vlan xx
int g0/7
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan xx

// Enable routing between vlans
ip routing
 
// Configure static route (destination address, mask, destination gateway)
ip route 172.110.2.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.2.2
 
// Save and exit
exit
write
 
// Show configurations
show vlan
show int vlanxx
show ip route
```

 - *The final configuration of my range is shown below, it is exactly the same with the topology. Then I only need to configure the network of every computer and server and connect their network cards to the switch interfaces accordingly*

## H3C
**1. Device overview**
 - *The H3C layer 3 switch in my lab is [S3600 series](https://www.h3c.com/en/Support/Resource_Center/HK/Switches/H3C_S3600/H3C_S3600_Series_Switches/default.htm)*

**2. Configure**
 - *Actually I didn't add this switch in my network in the end, so here I just simply record some commands of its configuration*

```
sys

// Create vlan "xx" and configure IP (address, mask)
vlan xx
int vlan-interfacexx
ip add 192.168.5.254 255.255.255.0

// Include ports in vlan xx
vlan xx
port g1/0/1
port g1/0/2 to g1/0/10

// H3C switches enable routing between vlans by default

// Configure static route (destination address, mask, destination gateway)
ip route-static 192.168.5.0 24 192.168.5.1

// Save and exit
q
save

// Show configurations
display ip routing-table
display vlan
display int vlan xx
```

# Router
<hr>

## UTT 
**1. Device overview**
 - *The router in the pic is [HiPER 840G](https://www.utt.com.cn/productdetail.php?modelid=178)*

<div align="center"> <img alt="dc12" src="https://github.com/jayzheng98/jayzheng98.github.io/blob/master/images/dc11.jpg?raw=true" width="550px"> </div><br>

**2. Connect for configuration**
 - *Use a PC to connect to its LAN interface, then open the browser and input the IP address of this LAN to login the configuration page (The default IP of my device is 192.168.1.1)*

**3. Configure**
 - *Usually we only need to focus on the configuration of **LAN interfaces**(left) and the **static route**(right)*
 - *Notice that if you changed the IP of LAN interface, the address of configuration page will change accordingly. In my case, it has changed to 172.110.2.1)*

<div align="center"> <img alt="dc13" src="https://github.com/jayzheng98/jayzheng98.github.io/blob/master/images/dc12.png?raw=true" width="340px">   <img alt="dc14" src="https://github.com/jayzheng98/jayzheng98.github.io/blob/master/images/dc13.png?raw=true" width="460px"> </div> 

**4. Further explanation**
 - *Here I want to emphasize the role of **static route**. In case you have to connect 2 networks that are **not** in the same segment, you have to configure the static route of both network bridges*
 - *In my case, network bridges are [Cisco Layer 3 switch](#cisco) and [UTT router](#utt). Devices in network segment 172.110.2.0/24 access devices in segment 192.168.3.0/24, 192.168.4.0/24 and 10.10.10.0/24 via the router's LAN4 (192.168.2.2), which is in the same network segment with switch's VLAN40 (192.168.2.1), vice versa*
