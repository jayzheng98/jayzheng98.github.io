# Introduction
As mentioned in the [project](), I've set up a simulation shooting range in my laboratory according to the network topology of high-speed railway signal system, and the topology diagram is shown below. This article roughly records my networking process

# Layer 3 Switch
## Cisco 
**1. Device overview**
 - *The layer 3 switch in the pic is [Catalyst 3560G series](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/switches/catalyst-3560-series-switches/series.html)*

**2. Connect for configuration**
 - *Usually there is a <u>console interface</u> behind the switch*

 - *Connect it with PC by the console cable*

**3. Set up for configuration**
 - *Download the [Hyper Terminal](https://www.hilgraeve.com/hyperterminal-trial/) which provides us with the terminal to configure devices*
 - *Set up a new connection, and select the <u>cluster communication port(COM)</u> which was former connected with console cable*

 - *When you see the* `Switch>` *, it means that you have successfully connected to your device*

**4. Configure**
 - *Here are some useful commands to configure Cisco switchs*
 
 ```java
 enable 
 
 // Show configurations
 show vlan
 show int vlanxx
 show ip route
 
 // Enable routing between vlans
 conf ter
 ip routing
 
 // Configure static route (destination address, mask, destination gateway)
 ip route 172.110.2.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.2.2
 
 // Create vlan "xx" and configure IP (address, mask)
 vlanxx
 int vlan xx
 ip add 192.168.4.1 255.255.255.0
 
 // Include ports in vlan xx
 int g0/7
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan xx
 
 // Save and exit
 exit
 write
 ```

 - *The final configuration of my range is shown below, it is exactly the same with the topology. Then I only need to configure the network of every computer and server and connect their network cards to the switch interfaces accordingly*
