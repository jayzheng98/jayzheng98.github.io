# Introduction
<hr>

**1.** Most parts of this project is also my graduation design. At present, I am still studying how to correlate abnormal data (attacks) mixed in system log data through knowledge graph

**2.** In recent years, the signal system of High-speed Railway is facing unprecedented security threats. On the one hand, the attack surface is expanding because of the deep integration of networking, information and control technology. On the other hand, we lack effective prediction or warning mechanisms for the Advanced Persistent Threats(APT). Therefore, this project proposes study on cybersecurity threat analysis and prediction technology of high-speed railway signal system
 - *It can be divided into 3 parts, and their relationships are shown below:*
