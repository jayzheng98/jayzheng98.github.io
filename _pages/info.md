* Hi! Thank you for your visit

* Iâ€™m Zhongyi, a MPhil at the Southwest Jiaotong University ([SWJTU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Jiaotong_University)), majoring in **Computer Science and Technology**. Currently, I am doing research in the field of cybersecurity supervised by [Prof. Lianshan Yan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=2ciZC4EAAAAJ) in the CIPC lab

* Before that, I was an undergraduate student majoring in **Network Engineering** at SWJTU. My interest at that time mainly focused on the **Embedded System** developing. I am in the top 14% of my major and have obtained the **Postgraduate Recommendation** to pursue a master degree without attending the exam

* To know more about me, you can have a view on following materials:
