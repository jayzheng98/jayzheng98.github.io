* Hi! Thank you for your visit

* Iâ€™m Zhongyi, an academic master student (similar with MPhil) at the Southwest Jiaotong University ([SWJTU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Jiaotong_University)), majoring in **Computer Science and Technology**. Currently, I am doing research in the field of cybersecurity supervised by [Prof. Lianshan Yan](https://faculty.swjtu.edu.cn/yanlianshan/en/index.htm) in the CIPC lab

* To be more specific, my current research interest is in **Anomaly Detection (Red vs. Blue)** and **Wireless Communication Security**

* Before that, I was an undergraduate student majoring in **Network Engineering** at SWJTU. My interest at that time mainly focused on the **Embedded System** developing. I am in the top 14% of my major and have obtained the **Postgraduate Recommendation** to study for master degree without attending the exam

* To learn more about me, you can have a view of my CV page [here](/cv)

* I have the habit of summarizing learning contents, see my notes [here](/notes)
