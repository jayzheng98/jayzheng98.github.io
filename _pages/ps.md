I am a master student who is doing research in the field of cybersecurity. To be more specific, I'm dedicated to improving the safety and security of cyber-physical system (CPS) via threat modeling and anomaly detection techniques. Different from the common Internet systems, CPSs are integrations of networking, computing systems and actual facilities that monitor and control entities in the physical environment. This means it will be ineffective to simply apply the cybersecurity research results for the Internet system to the CPS, but must take the functional safety attribute into consideration as well. 

Besides with the above progress I've made during my short research career, issues on both individual work of mine and general progress in the specific field have also occurred. It is these problems, or in other words, challenges, that constantly inspire and motivate me to pursue a PhD:
 - On the one hand, my current progress is rudimentary. The three years of master's degree is limited, since actually I have to spend most of my first year in class. Meanwhile, I am a pathfinder in this field in our laboratory, which means I have to research from scratch. As a result, I can only complete the design and construction of the underlying architecture of my research topic, but have no more time for the further research and development of the upper application, while which is the most challenging but splendid part. 
 - On the other hand, an emerging technique--knowledge graph (KG) applied to this field requires further research as well. In the early stage, people's research on the application of KG in the cybersecurity field mainly focused on the construction of reasonable and effective graphs. In recent years, the emergence of some commonly recognized graph models symbolizes the end of this stage. At present, how to utilize KG to solve practical problems (e.g., attack path analysis, attack prediction) under different situations has become the research hotspot.

However, I want to state that I do not mean all the aforementioned methods and techniques must be used to carry out research on this topic. If there were better choices I'm always willing to try, since I have a strong self-learning ability. By browsing my CV, you may notice that I have made some achievements in several areas that have no obvious relevance. In my undergraduate stage, I mainly focused on the development of embedded systems; While I am engaged in the research on cybersecurity at the graduate stage, I also participated in an algorithm competition in the field of data science. These experiences of exploring unknown areas have greatly improved my learning ability.
