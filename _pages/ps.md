I am applying for a PhD candidate to conduct research in the field of cybersecurity. To be more specific, I want to be dedicated to improving the safety and security of cyber-physical system (CPS) via threat modeling and anomaly detection techniques. Different from Internet systems, CPSs are integrations of networking, computing systems and actual facilities that monitor and control entities in the physical environment. This means it will be ineffective to simply apply the cybersecurity research outputs for the Internet system to CPS. Taking the railway as an example, attackers targeting such critical infrastructure will never stop at stealing passenger information or blackmailing computers like they usually do against Internet systems, but will try to disrupt the normal service process of the system to further cause severe safety accidents, such as derailment and train collision. This kind of advanced attack indicates that the consideration of combining safety and security is an inevitable research trend of CPS.



In the process of making the above progress, I also realized problems on both individual work of mine and general progress of a specific field:
 - On the one hand, my current progress is rudimentary. The three years of master's degree is limited, since actually I have to spend most of my first year in class. Meanwhile, I am a pathfinder in this field in our laboratory, which means I have to research from scratch. As a result, I can only complete the design and construction of the underlying architecture of my research topic, but have no more time for the further research and development of the upper application, while which is the most challenging but splendid part.
 - On the other hand, the emerging technique--knowledge graph (KG) requires further research as well. In the early stage, people's research on the application of KG in the cybersecurity field mainly focused on the construction of reasonable and effective graphs. In recent years, the emergence of some commonly recognized graph models symbolizes the end of this stage. At present, how to utilize KG to solve practical problems (e.g., attack path analysis, attack prediction) under different situations has become the research hotspot.

The issues above would probably be the challenges of my future research. However, I want to state that I do not mean all the aforementioned methods and techniques must be used to carry out research on this topic. If there were better choices I'm always willing to try, since I have a strong learning ability. By browsing my CV, you may notice that I have made some achievements in several areas that have no obvious relevance. In my undergraduate stage, I mainly focused on the development of embedded systems; While I am engaged in the research on cybersecurity at the graduate stage, I also participated in an algorithm competition in the field of data science. These experiences of exploring unknown areas have greatly improved my learning ability.
