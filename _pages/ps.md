I am a MPhil student who is doing research in the field of cybersecurity. To be more specific, I'm dedicated to improving the safety and security of cyber-physical system (CPS) via threat modeling and anomaly detection techniques. During my short research career, I've found problems on both individual work of mine and the general progress in this field. It is these problems, or in other words, challenges, that inspire and motivate me to pursue a PhD:
 - On the one hand, my current progress is rudimentary. The three years of master's degree is limited, since actually I have to spend most of my first year in class. Meanwhile, I am a pathfinder in this field in our laboratory. As a result, I can only complete the design and construction of the underlying architecture of my research topic, but have no more time for the further research and development of the upper application, while which is the most challenging but splendid part. 
 - On the other hand, an emerging technique--knowledge graph (KG) applied to this field requires further research as well. In the early stage, people's research on the application of KG in the cybersecurity field mainly focused on the construction of reasonable and effective graphs. In recent years, the emergence of some commonly recognized graph models symbolizes the end of this stage. At present, how to practically apply the specific KG in the  has become the research hotspot. Few research results were proposed, which shows that there are many treasures waiting to be discovered in this field.

In the end, I want to state that I do not mean all the aforementioned methods and techniques must be used to carry out research on this topic. If there were better choices I'm always willing to try, and I have a strong self-learning ability as well. By browsing my CV, you may notice that I have made some achievements in several areas that have no obvious relevance. In my undergraduate stage, I mainly engaged in the development of embedded systems; While I am engaged in the research on cybersecurity at the graduate stage, I also participated in a programming competition in the field of data science. In the process of exploring unknown areas, my learning ability has been greatly improved.
