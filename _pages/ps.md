1. why phd
2. which area
3. why good fit

I am a MPhil student who is doing research in the field of cybersecurity. To be more specific, I'm dedicated to improving the safety and security of cyber-physical system (CPS) via threat modeling and anomaly detection techniques. During my short research career, I've found problems on both individual work of mine and the general progress in this field. It is these problems, or in other words, challenges, that inspire and motivate me to pursue a PhD.

On the one hand, my current progress is rudimentary. The three years of master's degree is limited, since actually I have to spend most of my first year in class. Meanwhile, I am a pathfinder in this field in our laboratory. As a result, I can only complete the design and construction of the underlying architecture of my research topic, but have no more time for the further research and development of the upper application, while which is the most challenging but splendid part. On the other hand, an emerging technique--knowledge graph (KG) applied to this field requires further research as well. In the early stage, people's research on the application of KG in the cybersecurity field mainly focused on how to build reasonable and effective graphs. In recent years, the emergence of some commonly recognized graph models symbolizes the end of this stage.
